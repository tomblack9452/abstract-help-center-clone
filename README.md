This page is one of the first full page HTML/CSS files I've attempted. It isn't very responsive for mobile however it looks close to the original and is designed/spaced nicely imo.

I want to come back to this page and fix it up for mobile/tablet users. Overall I'm quite proud of this as it feels like a good start and a step in the right direction finally.
